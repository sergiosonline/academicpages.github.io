Abstract :

*An investigation into the design and training of two accessible GAN architectures:*

1. *Deep Convolutional GAN [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)*

2. *CycleGAN [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)*

*In this notebook I tackle a straightforward style transfer problem between Windows and Apple-style emojis, attempting to translate one style to the other in great detail, subject to limited processing power.*

This work was inspired by this AI-awareness [project](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/).
