Abstract:

*Road traffic safety is a crucial component of urban planning and development. Nowadays governments (and sometimes the private sector) dedicate significant resources to providing ample and sufficient infrastructure to accommodate diverse modes of transportation, thereby increasing the productivity of any given urban area. In this project we examine road safety in the City of Toronto from 2007 to 2017 and explore the areas with highest risk of a traffic incident, controlling for different factors.*
