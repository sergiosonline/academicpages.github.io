Abstract :

*I investigate the uptake of cigarette smoking in a representative sample of American teenagers, surveyed in the 2014+ American National Youth Tobacco Survey. I find greater variation in the rate of smoking uptake between school than between states. Moreover, we find that two comparable (with identical confounders and random geographical effects), non-smoking children do not have the same probability of trying cigarettes within the next monthâ€“such probability increases with age. Ultimately, we find that rural, white teenagers are more likely to try their first cigarette earlier than their urban counterparts, controlling for race and sex.*
