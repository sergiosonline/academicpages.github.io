Abstract :

*Previously difficult to fit and perform inference on, Bayesian models (and the programming and analytical frameworks to compute them efficiently) are enjoying a splendid renaissance across the board. Harnessing the novel Integrated Nested Laplacian Approximation (INLA) framework I carry out two investigations into the capabilities of Bayesian statistics to describe data with strong dependencies in time and space, shedding light on tough, but extremely rigurous, modelling techniques.*
