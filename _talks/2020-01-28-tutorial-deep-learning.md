This hands-on tutorial served as an introduction to the principal concepts around building, training, and understanding Artificial Neural Networks (NNs).

In this session I also covered an elementary computer vision task on the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.
