See the knitted RMarkdown notebook [here](https://sergiosonline.github.io/files/Intro_to_INLA.html).

This is a direct application of the Integrated Nested Laplacian Approximation (INLA) framework for approximate Bayesian inference. In this tutorial we examined math achievement scores (`MathAchieve` in the `MEMSS` library) across schools and individuals as a hierarchical regression problem.

We discussed the motivations for different priors and worked on fully utilizing the Initial Data Examination (IDE) as a crucial step to inform modelling choices.
