I am a graduate student in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (Canada).

My principal albeit ever-evolving academic interests are: Explainability, Inference, and Generalization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and Bayesian Inference and Computation.

I am also a semi-professional dancer, currently part of Toronto's prestigious [iFreestyle Latin Dance Company](http://www.ifreestyle.ca/).
