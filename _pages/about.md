I am a Data Scientist at [Nulogy](https://nulogy.com/) in Toronto, Canada. I hold an MSc (2019) and an HBSc (2015) in Statistical Sciences from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My principal albeit ever-evolving academic interests are: Explainability, Inference, and Generalization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and Bayesian Inference and Computation.

I am also a dance performer and teaching assistant, currently part of Toronto's prestigious [iFreestyle Latin Dance Company](http://www.ifreestyle.ca/).

Present and recent endeavors:
---

* I've accepted a teaching role at [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/) in their Toronto location, with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science.

* Principal designer of [Nulogy's](https://nulogy.com/) first live machine learning feature. Read more about it [here](https://nulogy.com/news-events/nulogy-news/first-ai-powered-capability/).

* Education on applied Bayesian inference and Machine Learning computation via [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and several Bayesian and Non-Bayesian meet-ups in Toronto

* Recommender systems and agile data science

* Selected to attend, and funded for, the [2019 CIFAR/Amii Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Graduate Summer School](https://dlrlsummerschool.ca/about/)

* Deep learning techniques for computer vision, unsupervised/representation learning, and transfer/meta-learning

* Principled and accessible evaluation of ML techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning
