I am a Data Scientist at [Nulogy](https://nulogy.com/) in Toronto, Canada. I am also a graduating graduate student in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My principal albeit ever-evolving academic interests are: Explainability, Inference, and Generalization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and Bayesian Inference and Computation.

I am also a semi-professional dancer, currently part of Toronto's prestigious [iFreestyle Latin Dance Company](http://www.ifreestyle.ca/).

Present and recent endeavors:
---

* Recommender systems and agile data science

* Selected to attend the [2019 CIFAR/Amii Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School](https://dlrlsummerschool.ca/about/)

* Deep learning techniques for computer vision, unsupervised/representation learning, and transfer/meta-learning

* Principled and accessible evaluation of ML techniques in supervised learning

* Modeling road safety in the City of Toronto
