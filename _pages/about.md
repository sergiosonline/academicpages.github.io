I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/), housed in San Francisco, CA. I hold an MSc (2019) and an HBSc (2015) in Statistics and Machine Learning from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am also a Lead Instructor in Data Science and Machine Learning at [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/).

My principal albeit ever-evolving academic interests are: Explainability, Inference, and Generalization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and Bayesian Inference and Computation.

I am also a dance performer and teaching assistant, currently part of Toronto's prestigious [iFreestyle Latin Dance Company](http://www.ifreestyle.ca/).
