I am a Data Scientist at [Nulogy](https://nulogy.com/) in Toronto, Canada. I hold an MSc (2019) and an HBSc (2015) in Statistical Sciences from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am also an Associate Instructor in Data Science and Machine Learning at [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/).

My principal albeit ever-evolving academic interests are: Explainability, Inference, and Generalization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and Bayesian Inference and Computation.

I am also a dance performer and teaching assistant, currently part of Toronto's prestigious [iFreestyle Latin Dance Company](http://www.ifreestyle.ca/).

Present and recent endeavors:
---

* I'm attending [StanCon2020](https://www.stancon.mc-stan.org/), the 24-hour Stan virtual conference!

* I've accepted a teaching role at [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/) in their Toronto location, with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science.

* Principal designer of [Nulogy's](https://nulogy.com/) first live machine learning feature. Read more about it [here](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/nulogy-releases-first-ai-powered-160000637.html).

* I've been selected as an Editorial Associate for [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/).

* Education on applied Bayesian inference and Machine Learning computation via several Bayesian and Non-Bayesian meet-ups in Toronto

* Differential Privacy and Reinforcement Learning

* Principled and accessible evaluation of ML techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning
